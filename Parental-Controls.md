## 7) Apps & Games Restrictions

### 7.1 Enforcement Model
Application access is restricted by explicitly blocking all non-approved applications.

### 7.2 Allowed Applications
- **Microsoft Edge** — filtered web browsing  
- **Roblox game client** — permitted game

### 7.3 Blocked Applications
All non-approved applications are explicitly blocked, including system apps, productivity tools, and the Microsoft Store. This prevents unapproved software usage and new application installations.

### 7.4 Risk Mitigation
Permitted applications are further controlled through age rating enforcement, screen time limits, purchase approval, and activity reporting.

## 8) Validation / Evidence
- **Screen Time:** Verified daily limits and availability windows.  
- **Web Safety:** Confirmed unsafe content filtering and SafeSearch enforcement.  
- **Apps & Games:**  
  - Edge and Roblox launch successfully under the child account.  
  - All other applications display a blocked status.  
  - Microsoft Store access is blocked, preventing new installs.

**Evidence:** Screenshots captured to verify configuration and enforcement.

## 9) Issues / Notes
- Microsoft Family Safety does not provide a single allow-only toggle; allow-listing is achieved through explicit blocking of non-approved applications.

---

## 10) Final Status
Parental controls were successfully configured to enforce age-appropriate access, content filtering, screen time limits, purchase approval, and application restrictions for the child account.
