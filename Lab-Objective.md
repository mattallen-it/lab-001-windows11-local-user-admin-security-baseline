Lab Objective

Purpose of the Lab

The purpose of this lab is to practice real-world Windows 11 user account management by configuring and validating administrator, standard user, and child accounts on a shared system. The focus is on applying least privilege, enforcing basic security controls, and confirming that access levels behave as expected.

Why Role-Based Accounts Matter

Role-based accounts reduce risk by ensuring users only have the permissions required to perform their tasks. Separating administrator and standard user access helps prevent accidental system changes, limits malware impact, and supports accountability when troubleshooting or auditing user activity.

How This Mirrors Tier 1 Help Desk Work

This lab reflects common Tier 1 responsibilities such as creating and managing user accounts, assigning appropriate permissions, troubleshooting access issues, and validating security settings. These tasks are routinely performed in managed environments where protecting systems and users is a core expectation.
